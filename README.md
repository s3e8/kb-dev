I want to make a... "thing" 
For fun, for learning, for me, and the sake of exploration
Especially around the Lisp dialect, ecosystem, and communities

## Questions
Lisp seems to be a "I've accumulated all these tools over time" kinda thing. To what extent is that because of emacs? 

So, it might seem like a mess. And it probably is. But it's a sandbox. 

## "Apps"
- journal
- dictionary
- triples
- taxonomies
- trading
- creative writing

## Functionalities
- publish
- associate
- etc
